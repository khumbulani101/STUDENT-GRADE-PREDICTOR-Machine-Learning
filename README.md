About Student Grade Predictor.

-Student Grade Predictor is a web app that uses machine learning to predict a student's final grade. It asks the user for a few details like:

How many hours they study per week
How many times they've been absent
Their grade from the first term
The app then uses this information to estimate the final grade using a Linear Regression model, which learns from past student data.

Features:
Grade Prediction: The app predicts the final grade based on study time, absences, and first-term grade.
Easy-to-Use Design: The app is designed to be simple and responsive, so it works well on both phones and computers.
Instant Results: After entering the data, the app shows the predicted final grade right away.
How It Works:
The user enters how much they study, how often they miss class, and their first-term grade.
The app uses the trained model to calculate the predicted grade.
The predicted grade is displayed to the user.
Tech Stack:
Backend: Python, Flask, scikit-learn (for machine learning)
Frontend: HTML, CSS (responsive design)
Data: A dataset of student performance stored in a CSV file.
